# Warholizer 

This is my personal, artwork-focused image editor.  I like to merge digital and analog art.

## Primary use case: Produce interesting clipart from web images for use in collage artwork.

You can quickly fill a sheet of printer paper with a stylized version of an image you copied to your clipboard, snapped from your camera, or uploaded from your filesystem.  Cut the paper printout with scissors and adhere it to your canvas.  Savor the experience.
